# TinyPNGHelper
## Introduction
https://tinypng.com/ is a amazing website to compress PNG images.

But it did not provide a package download function,so you must download the image one by one.

This chrome extension can help you auto-download images you upload in tinypng.com.
## How To Install
* First download TinyPNGHelper.crx
* Open Chrome->Settings->Extensions
* Drag TinyPNGHelper.crx into extensions
* Click allow,you will see the panda icon in top right corner

## How To Use
* Open https://tinypng.com/
* Try to upload some image
* Wait for progress
* Click the panda icon
* The image will download into default position

I hope it will be a simple demo to help you develop chrome extension.
